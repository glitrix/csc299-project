Topic: Formatting Chatbot Response Output

User Request:
The user asked to modify the aicliTest.py file to display chatbot responses in a nicer format instead of showing raw text with \n characters.

Solution Implemented:
Modified aicliTest.py to:
1. Extract just the content from the message using .content property
2. Added visual separators (===) to frame the response
3. Added a clear "CHATBOT RESPONSE:" header
4. Added proper spacing with newlines for better readability

Before:
print(completion.choices[0].message)

After:
response = completion.choices[0].message.content
print("\n" + "="*50)
print("CHATBOT RESPONSE:")
print("="*50)
print(response)
print("="*50 + "\n")

Result:
The chatbot's response now displays in a clean, formatted manner with proper line breaks instead of showing the raw message object with escaped newline characters.
