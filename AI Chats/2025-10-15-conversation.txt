USER:
So for my folder csc299-project I need to follow specific instructions for how everything should be formatted. Can you please edit the existing files so that it complies with these requirments:

create a prototype command-line application that allows storing, listing, and searching tasks stored in a JSON data file
put the code into files underneath a directory tasks1 in your csc299-project repository
add a README.md file with instructions for running your code inside the tasks1 directory
so your csc299-project repository should have a tasks1 directory, and Python file(s) plus a README.md file inside that tasks1 directory

ASSISTANT:
I'll help you reorganize your code to meet these requirements. Let me create a simplified task management application in a `tasks1` directory with the required structure.

[Created file: c:\Users\joshk\CSC299\csc299-project\tasks1\tasks.py]
[Created file: c:\Users\joshk\CSC299\csc299-project\tasks1\README.md]

Perfect! I've created a compliant task management application in the `tasks1` directory. Here's what I've set up:

## Created Structure:
```
csc299-project/
â””â”€â”€ tasks1/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.py          # Main application file
    â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Instructions for running the code
```

## Key Features:

### `tasks.py` - Command-line application with:
- âœ… **Storing tasks** - Saves tasks to `tasks.json` in the same directory
- âœ… **Listing tasks** - Display all tasks with details
- âœ… **Searching tasks** - Search by keyword in titles and descriptions
- **Additional features**: Add tasks, mark as complete

### `README.md` includes:
- Installation instructions (no dependencies needed!)
- Complete usage guide with examples
- Data storage explanation
- Troubleshooting tips

## Quick Start:

Navigate to the `tasks1` directory and try:
```bash
python tasks.py add "Complete project" "Finish the CSC299 assignment"
python tasks.py list
python tasks.py search "project"
python tasks.py complete 1
```

The application uses only Python's standard library (no external dependencies), stores data in JSON format, and provides a clean command-line interface. All requirements are met! ðŸŽ‰

USER:
Can you rename the prototypes directiory to "firstTest"

ASSISTANT:
I'll rename the `Prototypes` directory to `firstTest` for you.

[Executed command: cd c:\Users\joshk\CSC299\csc299-project; Rename-Item -Path "Prototypes" -NewName "firstTest"]

Done! I've successfully renamed the `Prototypes` directory to `firstTest`. Your project structure now looks like this:

```
csc299-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Chats/
â”œâ”€â”€ firstTest/          # (formerly Prototypes)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ studynavigator.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Text/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ tasks1/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.py
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

USER:
Can you now please make a .txt file including the date of when we had this coversation in the title. Then copy word for word of what was said in our coverstation and please place it under the folder AI Chats.
