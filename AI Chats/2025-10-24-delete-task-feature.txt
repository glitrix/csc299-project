Topic: Adding Delete Task Feature

==========================================

USER:
Can you add a feature to my task1 folder that allows the user to delete tasks through ID's of the task. For example "py tasks.py delete 1"

ASSISTANT:
I'll help you add a delete feature to your tasks application. Let me first examine the current code to understand how it works.

[Examined tasks.py and storage_markdown.py files]

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. I'll add a delete feature that:
1. Adds a `delete_task()` function in `storage_markdown.py` to delete the markdown file
2. Adds a `delete_task()` function in `tasks.py` to handle the command
3. Updates the main command handler and help text

Let me implement this:

[Made the following changes:]

Changes Made:

1. storage_markdown.py
   - Added `delete_task(task_id)` function that finds and removes the markdown file for a given task ID

2. tasks.py
   - Added `delete_task(task_id)` function that validates the task exists before deleting it
   - Added the "delete" command handler in the `main()` function
   - Updated the help text to include the delete command

Usage:

You can now delete tasks using:
```
python tasks.py delete 1
```

The feature:
- ✓ Checks if the task exists before attempting deletion
- ✓ Provides clear error messages if the task ID is not found or invalid
- ✓ Confirms successful deletion with the task title
- ✓ Handles errors gracefully if file deletion fails

Would you like me to test this functionality with one of your existing tasks?
